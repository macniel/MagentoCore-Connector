= Simple MagentoCore Connector
**MagentoCore Connector** or //MCC// is a simple Magento API Wrapper for Java based on its exposed
XMLRPC communication.

== Requirements

* xmlrpc-1.1 (included)

== Usage

import org.macniel.magentocore and org.macniel.magentocore.model 
to your project and construct a //MagentoCore// object. To bind this object to a xmlrpc interface
you have to call MagentoCore.connect with the string or url to the xmlrpc interface.

You may now login with your apiusername and apikey to explore your Magento based Webshop.

== Current Implementation

Currently only the customer, customer_address, cart, sales_order, catalog_product, and directory_*
resources are readable.
